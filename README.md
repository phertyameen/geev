## FRONTEND TECHNOLOGY STACK

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **State Management**: React Context API + SWR for data fetching
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (for scroll animations and transitions)
- **Theme System**: next-themes with light/dark mode support

## DOCUMENTATION

- [Theme System](docs/theme.md) - Light/dark mode implementation and usage guide
- [Components](docs/components.md) - Component library documentation

## BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE

The backend is integrated into the Next.js application using API Routes.

- **ORM**: Prisma (PostgreSQL)
- **API Routes**: Located in `app/api/`
- **Utilities**:
  - `lib/prisma.ts`: Prisma client singleton and connection testing.
  - `lib/api-response.ts`: Standardized API response helpers (`apiSuccess`, `apiError`).
- **Middleware**: Handles Request Logging and CORS in `middleware.ts`.

## Logout Behavior

The `/api/auth/logout` route is deprecated.

Use:
- `signOut()` from next-auth/react (client-side)
- `POST /api/auth/signout` (server-side)

This ensures proper session invalidation.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Application

If you're working on the frontend application, the `app` directory contains the Next.js codebase. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
   ```
3. Generate Prisma Client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing and creating pages and components. The backend API routes are located in `app/api/` and can be modified to implement the necessary functionality for the application.
Refer to the [app/README.md](app/README.md) for more detailed information on the frontend and backend infrastructure, documentation, and resources.

### Smart Contracts

The `contracts` directory contains the Soroban smart contracts for the platform. To get started with the smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. Install Soroban CLI:
   ```bash
   cargo install --locked soroban-cli
   ```
2. Build the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   soroban build
   ```
3. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stellar testnet or a local Soroban environment:
   ```bash
   soroban deploy --network testnet
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   soroban deploy --network local
   ```
4. Interact with the deployed smart contracts using the Soroban CLI or by integrating them into the frontend application.
   Refer to the [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) for more detailed information on the smart contract architecture, deployment, and interaction.
